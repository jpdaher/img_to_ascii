# img_to_ascii
###### _A simple java program that generates ascii art based on a given image._

## What will you find here?
- commented source code
- sample image and result
- executable jar file

## File description
### src (folder):
- contains the commented source code and its description
### ascii_art.txt: 
- example of output file
### convento.jpg:
- image used to generate the ascii art, it's "Convento da Penha", a famous landmark from my hometown
### img_to_ascii.jar:
- executable jar file

## Notes about the usage
1. You need to have a recent version of Java Runtime Environment installed (needed to run any Java app);
2. Download the img_to_ascii.jar file from this repository;
3. Put the jar file in a separate, empty folder (the result will be generated here);
4. Put the image you want to convert in the same folder, it needs to be an original .jpg file, and it will need to be renamed to "convento";
5. Double click the jar file and the result should pop-up.
6. If the result isn't appearing, try running it from cmd or open with javaw.exe.

### I would like to remind you to use only original .jpg files, renaming the image to change its file type does not work well
